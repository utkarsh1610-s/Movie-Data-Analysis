# Movie-Data-Analysis
Based on a relatively small dataset of movie with its relevant details (release month, year, cast, budget, collections and imdb), we conclude several data points like which month produces more hits, which actor has been profitable and which genre has a more success rate, etc. This helps to understand which movie/cast we should take bets on.
